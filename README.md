# Days Until Freedom

On February 2, 2021, the Prime Minister set out a roadmap to cautiously ease lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom. By the last step, which is reached no earlier than June 21, all legal limits on social contact are hoped to be removed. Days Until Freedom is a web archive and countdown that lives to emphasize people's anticipation for a normal life and invites the public to submit things that they look forward to doing in a post-covid England.
